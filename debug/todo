sparse recovery on the causal graph -- guessing the graph by seeing what was there before in the prior


1. model - optimal in some sense
2. minimal amount of data needed to identify something
3. find a class that is somewhat bayesian (approximate), but is still easy to compute
   - below interpolation threshold (still fit the data, but no 'extra space')
