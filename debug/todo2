1. can have a remote expert
2. can have money to fly them in
3. try 1 channel per object (1 object per channel), then can do softmax per channel ('location of the object map')
4. try binarizing probabilities (in 11-channel)
5. chess is similar to the grid-world because we have different layers for objefts. dota alsoneeds preprocessing

  rgb -> 1x2conv -> 11 channels (objects) -> 2x2conv -> flatten OR positional encoding H * [1...n] or [1...n]^TH

grid cells? sparse coding? fc net obviously not optimal because it's brittle

object-oriented RL -- reusing parts of the model, like all animals are ... and can be thirsty
for example, genetic algorithm to learn that movement both players in a grid-world wors the same way, but actions of one only affect this player
and not the other

theory
regret bound if we know that the model is sparse
works fine in case if have unlimited compute (aixi)
under what conditions sparsity of the model is superior to the sparsity of the features?
  give an example
find nash equilibria for 2-loss dynamics


also need positions of the objects
